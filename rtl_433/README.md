Wanted a more transperent add-on for rtl_433, so I made this.
I ended up making the image from the ground up.

## Credit

This add-on is spiritual sucessor, (not really based on) on pbkhrv's https://github.com/pbkhrv/rtl_433-hass-addons which is based on James Fry's [rtl4332mqtt Hass.IO Add-on](https://github.com/james-fry/hassio-addons/tree/master/rtl4332mqtt), which is in turn based on Chris Kacerguis' project here: [https://github.com/chriskacerguis/honeywell2mqtt](https://github.com/chriskacerguis/honeywell2mqtt), which is in turn based on Marco Verleun's rtl2mqtt image here: [https://github.com/roflmao/rtl2mqtt](https://github.com/roflmao/rtl2mqtt).
