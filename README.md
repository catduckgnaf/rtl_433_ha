# RTL_433 HA Community Edition


This repo, which contains the script and template config. This is on purpose, so those not using the add-on can benefit, and contribute to the project

## rtl_433 HA Addon

Here is my version of just the rtl_433 Next Add On. I am not actively working on it, because the current version works. I am spending time on my intergration instead, and when thats ready, will see what I neeed to customize.

Basically feel free to use this, or keep using the "old" one.

## What if you don't use HAOS or host rtl_433 elsewhere?

That is what makes this project great. Currently the rtl_433.conf is hosted here, in a simple, easy to use almost ready to go! 

## What about that horrible mqtt_discovery script that everyone says doesn't really work?

That is what makes this project great. Currently the script is hosted here, in a simple, easy to use almost ready to go! Downloaded and updated with the add-on.

This was my main motivation for the project, to make it easy no matter setup to make rtl_433 better, without the main project pushing breaking changes or convoluted configurations




## Todo plans

1. Add more to the auto discover script. We know the community done more. PIRs and Contact sensors are what we want, and they were not in the previous script I have started, but help is welcome

2. Documentation, and getting started improvements. That means good documentation for anyone looking to get into rtl_433 with an easy guide.

3. Make another repo for a standalone docker, for those not using HAOS to benefit. Will add discovery options and container variables.
